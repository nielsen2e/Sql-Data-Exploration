# Sql-Data-Exploration
I used Sql to perform covid data exploration using covid deaths and covid vaccinations table. It was initially a joined dataset but was splitted to be able to use the sql join 
function. Some of the sql functions used for exploration included Joins(inner join, left join), aggregate functions(sum,avg etc), casting data types(nvarchat to big int), CTE's
called Common Table Expressions, window functions and Temp tables which were used to store queries to avoid ambigous lines. Views were also created which were then transferred to
tableau for vizualizations.
